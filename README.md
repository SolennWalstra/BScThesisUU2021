The datasets used in this study are not included in the repository as the rights to regulate their public availability lie on their respective owner. Scripts can only run if you have the raw dataset that belongs to this project.

Make sure all files and the raw dataset are in the same folder. Filenames starting with H1_ are part of the main analysis. Filenames starting with EX_ are part of the exploratory analysis.

Run PERMUTATION_TEST.m before running H1_SD_COMBINED to create the necessary amp.diffs variable.

Amplitudes in the lineartests.m file are currently hardcoded. Update these values accordingly if changes are made to the analyses they are taken from (scripts starting with EX_).

Enjoy!
